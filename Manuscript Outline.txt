 - Background and Motivation
   - Superconducting nanowires are useful as single photon detectors
   - Useful to have photon detection in two dimensions
     - **REFERENCES** Particle detectors
   - Not feasible to use lots of independent detectors, with each constituting one pixel
     - Main issue - one readout per pixel creates too-large heat load
   - Through clever biasing and readout, can measure NxN array of detectors using 2N readout wires [@allman2015, @wollman2019]
     - Issue: all detectors are electrically-connected, and increased impedance of one increases current through others, creating attenuated copy of voltage spike on all readouts [@wollman2019]
     - Issue: Spike voltage amplitude decreases as number of detectors increases, limiting maximum size of array [@allman2015]
   - Problem with any row/column architecture: can't necessarily distinguish two photons landing in different places at same time [@wollman2019]
     - e.g. two photons may activate r1,r2,c1,c2 - possible locations are r1c1, r1c2, r2c1, r2c2.
   - Both issues are avoided by instead thermally-coupling rows and columns, as described below [@allmaras2020]
   - To thermally-couple rows and columns, motivated to learn relationship between hot spot size and device geometry
     - Want to make sure any hot spot generated on top layer will be detected by exactly one nanowire in bottom layer
     - Our paper measures hot spot width for various SNSPD geometries
     - We applied this technique to WSi films, can also be used with other materials

 - Theory
   - A nanowire can detect photons by being biased close to its critical current, so the temperature increase of one photon is enough to break superconductivity.
     - Resistive hot spot is formed, causing voltage to be created
       - **VALUES** Hot spot has resistance ~600 Ohm/square
       - Kinetic energy of electrons can be modelled by series inductor (kinetic inductance)
     - Size and duration of voltage spike is almost independent of energy imparted
       - Kinetic inductance drives current through resistive hot spot, dissipating power and increasing hot spot size
       - This power dissipation decreases with time as kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy
       - Result is a voltage spike
     - **VALUES** Can be approximated as series inductor with variable resistor, with resistance changing abruptly between ~1000 and 0 ohms
       - **VERIFY** Detector resets on timescale of LR, where L is kinetic inductance and R is resistance of hot spot
   - Readout wire can be thermally coupled to SNSPD
     - SNSPD directly exposed to photons, with meander creating large exposed area
     - Readout directly underneath SNSPD, thermally and electrically insulated from SNSPD and photons
     - Readout biased so that thermal energy from SNSPD hot spot will break its superconductivity, creating voltage spike
     - **VERIFY** Readout only tends to trigger when hot spot generated directly above it
   - Useful for detecting photon impacts over 2d array of pixels
     - Rows of vertically-oriented SNSPD wires can be measured to find horizontal location of photon impact
     - Columns of insulated detectors can be measured to find vertical position of hot spot
       - Similar to readouts, but completely aligned with SNSPDs above so that every SNSPD hot spot is detected
     - Look for coincidences in row and column spikes to locate photon impacts in both dimensions
       - Need to predict delay between hot spot formation on top and bottom layers
     - Allows placement of impact over NxN array of pixels with 2N readout wires from cryostat

 - Experimental Setup
   - SNSPD on top layer of chip with readout wire underneath
     - See figs. 1, 2
     - **VALUES** Specific parameters of chip - e.g. material, dielectric thickness, relevant manufacturing methods
         - 2x layers of WSi, spaced by 25 nm SiO2 dielectric.  Deposited on a Si wafer with 150 nm of thermal oxide.
         - More details in the "Methods" section of "2019 - McCaughan et al. - A superconducting thermal switch with ultrahigh impedance for interfacing superconductors to semiconductors". These are pretty standard descriptions, but still rewrite it so it's in your own words
   - **VALUES** Cooled to 1.0K in cryostat
   - **VALUES** __nm laser @ __dB applied to chip - specific model
   - **VALUES** Used Agilent 53131a pulse counter to measure number of pulses per __ms interval from SNSPD and readout wires
   - Devices: see fig. 7
     - **This will be a table**
     - All values rounded to nearest .5μm; for w x h meander, w is parallel to readout and h is perpindicular
     - Readout (identical for all devices):
       - 1μm-wide nanowire
       - 164.5x163.5μm meander - separated from SNSPD meander, and under dielectric
     - Device 1:
       - .5μm-wide nanowire
       - 67x68.5μm meander
     - Device 2:
       - .5μm-wide nanowire
       - 78.5x77.5μm meander
     - Device 3:
       - 1μm-wide nanowire
       - 136x134μm meander
     - Device 4:
       - 1μm-wide nanowire
       - 109x109.5μm meander

 - Results
   - Count rate vs. bias of SNSPD and readout wires
      - Observe baseline behavior
      - Grounded SNSPD while measured readout pulses, and vice-versa
      - See figs. 3, 4
   - Ratio of readout to SNSPD count rate, vs. SNSPD current
     - readout current fixed at largest attainable value before nonzero count seen in baseline graph
     - Expect to see: ratio that has constant mean and decreasing variance
       - Illustrated in EXPECTED_count_rate_snspd_sweep.png
       - SNSPD count rate increases from 0, and readout count rate is fixed proportion <1 of SNSPD count rate
       - Variance large initially because only small number of photons being detected
       - Region in which graph is nonzero matches that seen in SNSPD baseline behavior
   - Ratio of readout to SNSPD count rate, vs. readout current
     - SNSPD current fixed at three values: largest attainable value before overheating, and .5μA, 1μA below that
     - Expect to see: ratio that increases quickly from zero before becoming constant, with spike right before overheating
       - Illustrated in EXPECTED_count_rate_readout_sweep.png
       - SNSPD count rate fixed at some value throughout experiment
       - Small initially because with small readout current, most hot spots do not generate enough heat to break readout superconductivity
       - Becomes constant when all hot spots transmit enough heat to break superconductivity, and readout does not spike unless this happens
       - Spike eventually because with sufficiently-large current, readout can be triggered by photons that miss SNSPD - e.g. on readout meander
     - Constant value can be used to calculate hot spot width
     - As SNSPD current is increased, variance will decrease significantly and mean hot spot size will increase slightly
       - Decreased variance as number of counts per time interval increases
       - Increased hot spot size as amount of energy dissipated through hot spot increases
   - Can compute hot spot length as ((readout count)/(SNSPD count))/(2*(SNSPD length perpendicular to readout))
     - Expect to see matching results for above two experiments
     - Sources of error:
       - Low because does not account for possibility of hot spot wrapping around corner
       - Off because don't know how aligned hot spot needs to be with readout wire
         - If lateral heat transfer, amount of heat will increase when readout is closer to center of hot spot (fixme see supplementary figure 3 in "2019 - McCaughan et al. - megaohm_heater_supplementary.pdf")
         - Might be enough heat to trigger readout even if hot spot is not directly, or fully, under it
       - Off because SNSPD and readout might have different time constants - photon might trigger one before other has recovered
       - **QUESTION** Do we know the proportion of SNSPD spikes that trigger readout spikes when wires are directly above one-another so always hot spot overlap?

 - Conclusion
   - Can see that __ is the relationship between device geometry and hot spot width.
   - This method can be applied to test hot spot width for an SNSPD geometry before applying it in, e.g. row/column array.
